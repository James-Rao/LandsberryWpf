1)	The first should be a small sample of C# which shows your own personal coding style, it should demonstrate the use of some of the more common features in the language that you find useful. Please feel free to use code you have previously written for yourself.


Please review the project Boggle



2)	 The second should be a sample of some XAML for WPF demonstrates some of the more common features such as binding, styles, templates, and resources. Again, please feel free to use code you have previously written.


Please review the project WpfDemo



3)	And lastly, below is a simple coding task. Could you please send us your solution to the following problem:
 
¡°Write C# code to implement an efficient algorithm to create a 52 element array containing the numbers 1 to 52, randomly ordered. Each number should only occur once in the resultant array.

Assume that you have access to a function called Random() that generates a random number in a specified range. This function will accept two parameters. The first is the LowNumber of the range and the second is the HighNumber of the range. The function will return a value that is >= LowNumber and <=HighNumber.¡±


Please review the project ArrayRandomFiller and it uses Boggle.RandomPool<T>.
